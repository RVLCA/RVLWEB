        <h1>Privacy Policy for AuthnTick</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Relief Validation Limited (RVL) values privacy and is dedicated to maintaining the confidentiality and security of all data associated with the use of the Authenticator. This privacy policy outlines how the Authenticator operates, ensuring transparency and trust in its usage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>The Authenticator does not collect, store, or process any personal information. Its primary function is to verify the authenticity of data encoded in Visible Digital Seals (VDS) without accessing or retaining any user-specific details.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. How the VDS Verifier Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Authenticator reads encrypted data within a Visible Digital Seal (VDS), such as QR codes, to validate its authenticity.</li>
                <li>Verification is conducted using cryptographic mechanisms. To facilitate this, a digital certificate is securely installed within the verifier. This certificate is used solely for decrypting and verifying the VDS data.</li>
                <li>The verification process is performed entirely locally on the device, ensuring that no data is transmitted externally or retained after the process is complete.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Although no personal information is collected or processed, Relief Validation Limited ensures the Authenticator adheres to industry-leading security practices to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The verification process is encrypted and operates in a secure, isolated environment.</li>
                <li>Regular security reviews and updates are conducted to maintain the application’s integrity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Third-Party Integration</h2>
            <p>The Authenticator may rely on third-party cryptographic libraries or services to perform verification tasks. These third-party tools are strictly limited to the application’s functionality and do not collect user data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. Your Rights and Transparency</h2>
            <p>As the Authenticator does not collect personal data, no user rights concerning data access, correction, or deletion apply. Users can use the verifier with full assurance that their privacy is uncompromised.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
            <p>Relief Validation Limited may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in technology or regulatory requirements. Any updates will be made available within the application and on our website, with the effective date of the revised policy clearly stated.</p>
